## Final Exercise: Build a Cash Register Machine

The cash register should be able to:
1. **Add items** to a shopping cart.
2. **Calculate total price** of all items.
3. **Apply discounts** (10% if total > 400).
4. **Process payment** and determine if the customer has enough money.

### Available Items:
- Phone: $300
- Smart TV: $220
- Gaming Console: $150

### Key Methods:
1. `addItem(itemName)`: Adds an item to the shopping cart if available.
2. `calculateTotalPrice()`: Calculates the total cost.
3. `pay(amount)`: Processes payment, applies discounts, and gives change if applicable.

### Implementation Steps:
- Use objects, arrays, conditionals, and loops to build the program.
- Print appropriate messages using `console.log()`.
- Handle edge cases where payment is greater than, equal to, or less than the total price.

Give it a try first before checking the solution. Good luck!
