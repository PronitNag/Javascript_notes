# what is them difference in the object properties in DOM for inline and block?

- In the DOM (Document Object Model), inline and block elements have different property behaviors due to their display types. Here are the key differences in their object properties:

  offsetWidth and offsetHeight <br / >
Block elements: Have both offsetWidth and offsetHeight because they take up full width and have a defined height.<br / >
Inline elements: Usually have offsetWidth and offsetHeight as 0 unless they have a non-zero padding, border, or line-height.<br / >

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    <div></div>
    <span></span>

    <script>
        const blockElement = document.querySelector("div");
        console.log(blockElement.offsetWidth); // Full width of the div

        const inlineElement = document.querySelector("span");
        console.log(inlineElement.offsetWidth); // Usually 0 unless styled


    </script>
</body>
</html>
```
