# JavaScript Introduction

JavaScript was created around April 1995 by Brendan Eich. At the time, he was working to develop a browser for a company called Netscape. He was told that he only had 10 days to design and code a working prototype of a programming language that could run on the browser.

He needed to create a language that appealed to non-professional programmers like Microsoft Visual Basic.

The reason he was given only 10 days was that Netscape needed to release its browser, which at the time was in competition with Microsoft.

In the beginning, JavaScript was not as powerful as it is today, since it was originally designed to add interaction and animation for web pages. It wasn't until 2005 when jQuery and AJAX were released that JavaScript began to be used in every website.

People simply didn't have an easy alternative to jQuery and AJAX for DOM manipulation and sending asynchronous requests. Plus, an active community of JavaScript developers kept adding new features to the library.

Then Google launched its modern Chrome browser, and Facebook started getting more people online. JavaScript began to grow to accommodate the ambitions of these giant internet companies.

Browsers began developing APIs that you could use in JavaScript. JS could retrieve information such as IP addresses and geographic locations from the browser, adding more power to internet companies to localize the features of their websites.

Then another innovation happened to make JavaScript even more powerful.

A server-side environment named **Node.js** was released in 2009, allowing JavaScript to run on the server side like PHP, Java, Python, Ruby, and many more. It also enabled devs to develop full-stack web applications using only JavaScript.

Today, JavaScript is a language that can power the web, desktop, and mobile applications.

Learning JavaScript is now critical for people who want to be web developers.

## Why learn JavaScript?

There are 4 good reasons why you need to learn and deeply understand JavaScript:

1. JavaScript is the only language that works in the browser
2. It's fairly easy to learn (but hard to master)
3. It's an essential language for making web applications
4. There are many career opportunities for JavaScript devs

Learning JavaScript opens tremendous opportunities where you can be a frontend, backend, or mobile developer.

Basically, learning JavaScript is a gateway to career improvements in tech.

## JavaScript vs Java

In the beginning, JavaScript was actually named **LiveScript**. It was renamed to **JavaScript** because Java was a very popular programming language.

Since most software developers were already familiar with Java, the name JavaScript was thought to help in marketing JavaScript as a great programming language and draw the interest of developers at the time.

Just to be clear, **JavaScript and Java are two completely different programming languages**. You don't need to know Java to learn JavaScript (or the other way around). :)
