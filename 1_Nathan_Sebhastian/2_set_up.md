## 2 - How to Set Up Your Computer

To write a program using JavaScript, you need to install 2 free tools that are available for all operating systems.

### How to Install VSCode

The first tool to install is **Visual Studio Code**.

Visual Studio Code (or **VSCode** for short) is a text editor program created for the purpose of writing code. Aside from being free, VSCode is open source and available on all major operating systems.

You can use VSCode on **Windows, macOS, and Linux**, so if you don't have a text editor on your computer, I recommend that you install VSCode [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

Now that you have a text editor to write JavaScript code, you need a software to run JavaScript code. Let's install **Node.js** next.

### How to Install Node.js

To run JavaScript outside of the browser, you need to install **Node.js**, which is essentially a JavaScript runner.

Simply go to the Node.js website at [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) and download the latest **LTS version** for your computer. Once the download is complete, install it on your system.

You need to run Node.js using the console, so open your command line or terminal application and run the following command:

```sh
node -v
```

This command will output the version of your freshly installed Node.js into the console.
